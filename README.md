## Game Instructions
Tic-Tac-Toe is a very popular game, which consists in making a sequence of three symbols in either a row, column or diagonal in a 3x3 board.

- The game displays the board with the a welcome note on top.
- You will be prompted as a first player to enter your preferred name.
- You will be prompted as a second player to enter your preferred name.
- You will be prompted to choose who should go first.
- You will be provided with the choices you can pick from that is, between 1 - 9.
- You will play in turns, in sequence till the board is full then it will announce the game results ie, draw or winner.
- If you want to play again you can say (Y) yes or entirely quit the game by choosing (N).

## Testing With Rspec.

- Boot up your terminal and punch in ``gem install rspec`` to install RSpec. Once that‚Äôs done, you can verify your version of RSpec with ``rspec --version``, which will output the current version of each of the packaged gems. Take a minute also to hit ``rspec --help`` and look through the various options available.

- Finally, cd into a project directory that you wish to configure for use with RSpec and type ``rspec --init`` to initialize RSpec within the project. This will generate two files, ``.rspec`` and ``spec/spec_helper.rb``

- To check whether your test are passing or failing, go to your terminal and type ``rspec``.
